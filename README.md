# run-xcode
Small script to run XCode on unsupported Versions of macOS


How it works:

  The script uses the Exeutable called "open" (located in /usr/bin/open) with the Parameter "/Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode
  
 Note: 
  The drive from which Xcode should run *must* be called "Macintosh HD"!
  
 
 How to run:
  
  1.) Download script from [Releases](https://github.com/nocontent06/run-xcode/releases)
  2.) Open Terminal
  3.) Type "chmod +x " and drag the file into Terminal and press Enter
  4.) Drag the file again into Terminal and press Enter again
